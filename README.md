This service helps you to run [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) seamlessly when running tests with [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io). It uses the well known [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central) repository to download the WireMock jar for you which is then automatically installed, started and stopped. Stay up to date by joining the community over at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/erwinheitzman/wdio-wiremock-service) for help and support.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -D wdio-wiremock-service
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here.](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html)

## Configuration

In order to use the service with the wdio testrunner you need to add it to your service array:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
export.config = {
  // ...
  services: ['wiremock'],
  // ...
};
```

IMPORTANT in version 5 of WebdriverIO you will need to set the port manually!

When using webdriverio standalone you need to add the service and trigger the `onPrepare` and `onComplete` hooks manually. An example can be found [here](####webdriverio-standalone) (the example makes use of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)):

## Usage

In the root directory (default `./mock`) you find two subdirectories, `__files` and `mappings` which are used for your fixtures and mocks.

### Fixtures

WireMock allows you to use fixture files alongside your mocks, place these in the `__files` directory.

Example of a fixture:

```json
Hello world!
```

### Mocks

In order for WireMock to find your mocks, place them in the `mappings` directory.

Example of a mock:

```json
{
  "request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "/api/mytest"
  },
  "response": {
      "status": 200,
      "body": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

Example of a mock with a fixture:

```json
{
  "request": {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "/api/mytest"
  },
  "response": {
      "status": 200,
      "bodyFileName": "hello-world.json"
  }
}
```

### HTTP API

You can also create a stub mapping by posting to WireMockâ€™s HTTP API, this is useful when you want to set different states.

#### Basic stubbing

The following code will configure a response with a status of 200 to be returned when the relative URL exactly matches /example/data (including query parameters). The body of the response will be `{ "dummy": [{ "data": "example" }]}` and a Content-Type header will be sent with a value of application/json.

```js
it(`a mocked api response created using WireMock's HTTP API`, async () => {
  const expectedRes = {
    dummy: [
      {
      data: 'example'
      }
    ]
  };

  const body = JSON.stringify({
    request: {
        method: 'GET',
        url: '/example/data'
    },
    response: {
      status: 200,
      jsonBody: expectedRes
    }
  });

  await browser.call(async () => {
    await nodeFetch('http://localhost:8080/__admin/mappings/new', { method: 'POST', body })

    await nodeFetch('http://localhost:8080/example/data')
      .then((res: any) => res.json())
      .then((body: any) => expect(body).toEqual(expectedRes))
    });
});
```

To create the stub described above via the JSON API, the following document can either be posted to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings` or placed in a file with a .json extension under the mappings directory as a fixture.

#### Saving stubs

Stub mappings which have been created can be persisted to the mappings directory via a call to WireMock by posting a request with an empty body to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings/save`.

#### File serving

When running the standalone JAR, files placed under the `__files` directory will be served up as if from under the docroot (rootDir), except if stub mapping matching the URL exists. For example if a file exists `__files/things/myfile.html` and no stub mapping will match `/things/myfile.html` then hitting `http://<host>:<port>/things/myfile.html` will serve the file.

#### Removing stubs

Stub mappings can be deleted via the HTTP API by issuing a `DELETE` to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings/{id}` where id is the UUID of the stub mapping, found in its id field.

#### Reset

The WireMock server can be reset at any time, removing all stub mappings and deleting the request log by sending a `POST` request with an empty body to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/reset`.

#### Getting all currently registered stub mappings

All stub mappings can be fetched by sending a `GET` to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings`.
Optionally limit and offset parameters can be specified to constrain the set returned e.g. `GET` `http://localhost:8080/__admin/mappings?limit=10&offset=50`.

#### Getting a single stub mapping by ID

A single stub mapping can be retrieved by ID by sending a `GET` to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/mappings/{id}`.

#### More information

For more information about stubbing check [WireMock's official documentation](http://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/).

### Writing tests

Writing your first test is really straight forward:

#### Using the WDIO testrunner in synch mode

```js title="./test/specs/mytest.js"
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const assert = require('assert');

it(`should assert the mock data`, () => {
  browser.call(async () => {
    await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/mytest')
      .then((res) => res.text())
      .then((body) => {
          // assert that the request body returns the expected value
          assert.equal(body, 'More content');
      });
  });
});
```

#### Using the WDIO testrunner in async mode

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const assert = require('assert');

it(`should assert the mock data`, async () => {
  await browser.call(async () => {
    await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/mytest')
      .then((res) => res.text())
      .then((body) => {
          // assert that the request body returns the expected value
          assert.equal(body, 'More content');
      });
  });
});
```

#### Using WebdriverIO Standalone

```js title="./test/specs/mytest.js"
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch')
const { remote } = require('webdriverio')
const { launcher } = require('wdio-wiremock-service') // import the service

const WDIO_OPTIONS = {
  port: 9515, // chromedriver port
  path: '/', // remove `path` if you decided using something different from driver binaries.
  capabilities: {
      browserName: 'chrome'
  },
}

let wiremockLauncher = new launcher() // create instance of the service
let client;

beforeAll(async () => {
  await wiremockLauncher.onPrepare(WDIO_OPTIONS) // run the onPrepare hook
  client = await remote(WDIO_OPTIONS)
})

afterAll(async () => {
  await client.deleteSession()
  await wiremockLauncher.onComplete() // run the onComplete hook
});

test('should showoff a mocked api response', async () => {
  await client.call(async () => {
    await nodeFetch('http://localhost:8080/api/mytest')
      .then((res) => res.text())
      .then((body) => expect(body).toEqual('Hello world!'));
  });
});
```

## Options

The following options can be added to the service.

    ['wiremock', { port: 8181 }]
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### rootDir
Path where WireMock will look for files.

Type: `String`

Default: `./mock`

Example:
```js
// wdio.conf.js

  services: [
    ['wiremock', { version: '2.25.1' }]
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### stdio
Level of logging (for simplicity this can be set to: `pipe`, `ignore`, `inherit`).
For more information see [stdio](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_stdio).

Type: `Array | String`

Default: `inherit`

Example:

  ],
  // ...
};
```

### args
List where you can pass all the supported arguments for configuring WireMock

Note: you cannot pass the options (`port`, `rootDir`, `stdio`, `mavenBaseUrl`) here as they will be ignored.

Type: `Array`

Example:
```js
// wdio.conf.js
export.config = {
  // ...
  services: [
    ['wiremock', {
      args: [ '--verbose', '--match-headers' ]
    }]
  ],
  // ...
};
```
